# swagger-js-api

## Why

Based on [Swagger Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) building a basic connector for the awesome [Calendar42](http://calendar42.com) [REST API](https://calendar42.com/api/docs/).

## Goal

To create an agnostic js-lite client that will be able to manage all changes in the REST side without change.
